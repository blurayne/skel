# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## A Preamble And A Standpoint 

> **A Code of Conduct is shall NOT be weaponized for shameless self-radicalization!**

We believe that each person has the right to live his life as he chooses as long
as he respects the equal rights of others. Every participant should be part in defending
each person’s right to life, their liberty and their property. In our view voluntary
agreement is the gold standard of human relationships everyone should strife in learning
social and technical skills.

If there is no good reason to forbid something – a good reason being that it violates
the rights of others – it should be allowed. Force should be reserved for prohibiting
or punishing those who themselves use force such as criminals, parts of government and
many corporations (non-interventionism).

Governments, organizations and corporations should not use their powers to censor speech, conscript
the young, prohibit voluntary exchanges, steal or “redistribute” property, or
interfere in the lives of individuals who are otherwise minding their own business.

We believe that that code should be applied consistently, even to the actions of
governments, organizations, corporations. Rule by law should be restricted to protecting people
from violations of their rights and not enforcing cultural narratives.

We encourage you to take on responsibility for your actions against yourself and towards
others – and not relying on some kind of nanny. Yet we try to keep voluntary
participants in this project free from harassment to do their contribution and
free and accepted in our community. We reserve ourselves the right to keep you off
the lawn and god damn it we do shoot if we don't don't comply with our standards.

And yes, these standards may not be perfect but you know: Freedom is a loaded shotgun.

We explicitly welcome every gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
fetishes (seen as over-attribution of values on specific things mostly based on
personal experience), disability, physical, appearance, body size, race, age, religion
or any other status not only protected by laws. This is the ultimate drug against war.
We believe in free speech and trade and exchange among people which has always had a peace
keeper function throughout history.

We believe in a free software, science and society are more to diversity and free discussion
without taboos – more than the common conforming public mainstream. But also keep
the possibility in mind that you might be the one with dysfunctional habits. Know yourself
and keep in mind than people feel attacked when criticizing their way of life or some irrational
beliefs. Do your homework and use your brain!

To put it in simple terms: if you are not nice and accept others with their 
distinctiveness we are not nice either.

Be respectful and mind the feelings of others when crude vibrations are on the rise!

Linear causality and scapegoats should be rendered a thing of the past!
